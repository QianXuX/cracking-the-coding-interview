// Enum Type
//
// An enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set
// of predefined constants. The variable must be equal to one of the values
// that have been predefined for it. Because they are constants, the names of
// an enum type's fields are in uppercase letters. In the Java programming
// language, you define an enum type by using the enum keyword. For example,
// you would specify a days-of-the-week enum type as:
public enum Day {
    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,
    THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY
}
